# Development plan

These are ideas for improvements. They are not in prioritised order.

## Polishing for MVP

Bring the event booking system towards a usable MVP:

- Make the upcoming event overview look nice (CSS styling provided reference image)
- Add optional image to event and make the backend crop the image
- When booking as a logged in user, assume several of the fields are known in the backend

## New features

Some ideas not in prioritised order:

- OAuth via Google, Apple, Facebook, GitHub, TikTok (start with one, e.g. GitHub)
- Webshop functionality for selling items instead of events
- Payment integration with Stripe

## Improving the codebase

- Add eslint/eslint-typescript by copying an already made eslint.config.js.
- Make sure eslint is configured to work for both the client and the server, respectively.
